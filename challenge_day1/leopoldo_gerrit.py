    return "The low hum of the arcane device filled the dusty laboratory. Professor Alistair Finch, polishing his spectacles, saw the glyphs on its surface begin to glow with an eerie light. He turned to his colleague, 'Dr. Evelyn Reed, I believe our moment has arrived.'"

    return "Suddenly, the device flared, projecting a holographic map onto the ceiling. It wasn't a map of Earth. 'Incredible,' Dr. Evelyn Reed whispered, her eyes tracing the alien constellations. Professor Alistair Finch, however, noticed a small, blinking icon in the corner of the projectionâ€”a countdown."

def get_paragraph_act3():
    return "'We have to shut it down,' Professor Alistair Finch urged, his voice tight with panic as the countdown ticked faster. But Dr. Evelyn Reed was already at the console, her fingers flying across the keys. 'Shut it down?' she countered, a wild look in her eyes. 'Alistair, I'm just getting it started.'"
